# 3-steps-form

A form that is separated to 3 steps.
After filling each page, you can swipe go to the next or previous page by clicking on the buttons put at the bottom of the pages.
There are 2 necessary inputs in the first step.If the user tries to leave them blank, they can't go to the next step or save the form.
I've used different types of inputs in this form, like text typed inputs or checkboxes or even a radio input which has a button-like appearance.
Technologies i've used for this:  HTML, css, bootstrap rtl 3.3.7 , jquery
